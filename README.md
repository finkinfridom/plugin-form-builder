# Payload Form Builder Plugin

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@finkinfridom/payload-plugin-form-builder)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@finkinfridom/payload-plugin-form-builder)

This is a **fork** from the official package [here](https://github.com/payloadcms/plugin-form-builder).

This fork is needed as the official package is missing (at the moment) the capabilities to properly work with localizations when sending emails.
